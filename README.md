# Glances - An eye on your system

## Summary

**Glances** is a cross-platform monitoring tool which aims to present a
maximum of information in a minimum of space through a curses or Web
based interface. It can adapt dynamically the displayed information
depending on the user interface size.

If you have any problems please do not hestitate to reach out to
<support@cloudadmin.io>

## Installation

Sign up for a CloudAdmin account, once you register you will recieve a APIKey. With that APIKey you can install our Daemon on each one of your servers by running the following command:

(Curl is required for this)
```
bash <(curl -s -L http://bit.ly/cloudadmin-daemon) APIKey
```

OR

Drop the install.sh script onto your system and execute it.

```
./install.sh APIKey
```

Your servers will immediately start reporting into our system, as well the operating systems below will automatically have this our daemon installed as part of their initialization.
